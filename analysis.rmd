## Concurrent Linked Lists

This repport intends to show the results of the experiments with the different implementations of a concurrent linked list in C. Each execution was repeated 5 times in order to get the average time for each number of threads.

```{r cars}
summaryDf <- read.delim("data.txt", colClasses = character(), header = TRUE, sep = ",")
summaryDf = summaryDf %>%
  group_by(Algorithm, Threads) %>%
  summarize(AvgTime=mean(Time)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Threads,y = AvgTime(s))) +
      geom_point(aes(x = Threads,y = AvgTime, colour=Algorithm)) + scale_y_log10()

summaryDf
```
